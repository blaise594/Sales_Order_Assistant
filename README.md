  - Sales Order Assistant eliminates tedious data entry often encountered in companies that broker obsolete and 
  hard to find electronic parts by providing a customer portal where the customer can log in to an account created 
  for them and can send their purchase orders through a form within this portal instead of through email. 
  The information from the form is then automatically populated into a customized database system.
